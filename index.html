                <p class="paragraph">Hey myself Hemil I'm from Surat, Gujarat, India. I was born on 18th October 2003.
                    In India I completed my
                    12th grade. Right now my course is Interactive media design in Algonquin College, Ottawa. While
                    schooling I developed my interest in some sports like Football, Cricket, Volleyball, Speedball. I'm
                    a
                    national Speedball player by the way. Besides that I love Travelling. I never missed any school
                    trip. The trip in which we had been at
                    Igatpuri I enjoyed a lot. It was my last trip with my school friends. About my family I have an
                    elder
                    sibling who's a singer. My dad is a pharmasist and mom is house wife. About me I want to become a
                    professional coder and graphics designer. By passion I'd love be a cosmologist. I even do watch
                    videos
                    sometimes about Space science. Fun facts: my sibling is a classical singer. My dad does Yoga for
                    like 2 hours a day. My mom watches TV shows a lot. Things you should know about me: I like eating
                    popcorn with mango-milkshake, serious moments makes me laugh I dont know why, I like stargazing more
                    than anything.</p>
